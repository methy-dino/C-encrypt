# C-encryp, an AES implementation.

### How to use it?
The library has two main functions, ```encrypt\_data```, and ```decrypt\_data```, both of which take a ```char*``` (with assumed length of 16), a key, and the key's length (in bytes), keys can be any length, but it is recommended to make them bigger than 16 bytes.\
